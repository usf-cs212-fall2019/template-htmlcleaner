HTML Cleaner
=================================================

Eventually, we want to be able to crawl the web and parse web pages into plain text words. As such, we must be able to remove all of the HTML code from that web page. This assignment is a step towards this functionality. This homework is broken into the following classes:

  - `HttpsFetcher.java`: This is a general HTTP(S) fetcher and is the same as the lecture code.

  - `HtmlFetcher.java`: This is a variant of HTTP(S) fetcher specifically for HTML content. There are a few methods here you must implement.

  - `HtmlCleaner.java`: This is a class dedicated to removing HTML tags from a webpage, leaving only the raw text. There are several methods here you must implement.

*Note:* Before using these classes with project 4, you will need to make some modifications. Specifically, you will eventually need to make your `LinkParser` and `HtmlCleaner` work together so that you parse links after stripping block elements, but before stripping tags and entities. (This is not required for the homework, however.)

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------

The official name of this homework is `HtmlCleaner`. This should be the name you use for your Eclipse Java project and the name you use when running the homework test script.

See the [Homework Guides](https://usf-cs212-fall2019.github.io/guides/homework/) for additional details on homework requirements and submission.
